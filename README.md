# Features

### Explore Electron

![Screenshot: Electron App running](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1426799/52155856-c0bb4300-2639-11e9-9962-a6354d08dc5a.jpg)

Try Electron without installing any dependencies: Fiddle includes everything
you'll need to explore the platform. It also includes examples for every API
available in Electron, so if you want to quickly see what a
[BrowserView][BrowserView] is or how the [desktopCapturer][desktopCapturer]
works, Fiddle has got you covered.

### Code with Types

Fiddle includes Microsoft's excellent Monaco Editor, the same editor powering
Visual Studio Code. It also installs the type definitions for the currently
selected version of Electron automatically, ensuring that you always have
all Electron APIs only a few keystrokes away.

### Compile and Package

Fiddle can automatically turn your experiment into binaries you can share with
your friends, coworkers, or grandparents. It does so thanks to
[electron-forge][electron-forge], allowing you to package your fiddle as an
app for Windows, macOS, or Linux.

### Start with Fiddle, Continue Wherever

Fiddle is not an IDE â€“ it is however an excellent starting point. Once your
fiddle has grown up, export it as a project with or without
[electron-forge][electron-forge]. Then, use your favorite editor and take on
the world!
