# Features

### Live Feedback

Better BAT shows misconfigurations with your import file before you make any changes. This saves engineers from issues stemming from bad data collections, typo's or features not supported all phone models.

### Auto-Fix

Better BAT has a built in auto-fix feature to help engineers fix missing or misconfigurations. Currently Auto-Fix will help solve the following:

* Phone Button Template
  * Auto-Fix will analyze the number of lines and speed dials configured on each device. It will then try to select the best phone template that matches the configuration. (Note: Auto-Fix will only select phone templates that match the exact phone model)
* Item 2

### Handsontable

Fiddle includes Microsoft's excellent Monaco Editor, the same editor powering
Visual Studio Code. It also installs the type definitions for the currently
selected version of Electron automatically, ensuring that you always have
all Electron APIs only a few keystrokes away.

### Compile and Package

Fiddle can automatically turn your experiment into binaries you can share with
your friends, coworkers, or grandparents. It does so thanks to
[electron-forge][electron-forge], allowing you to package your fiddle as an
app for Windows, macOS, or Linux.

### Start with Fiddle, Continue Wherever

Fiddle is not an IDE â€“ it is however an excellent starting point. Once your
fiddle has grown up, export it as a project with or without
[electron-forge][electron-forge]. Then, use your favorite editor and take on
the world!
